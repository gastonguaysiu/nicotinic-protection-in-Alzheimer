**Bioinformatics Analysis of ncRNA and Gene Expression in Neurodegenerative Diseases**

**Project Overview**
Welcome to my GitHub repository showcasing my first bioinformatics project. This project focuses on the role of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) and genes in the human brain, particularly in relation to synaptic signaling, energy production, protein homeostasis, and their association with aging and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD). The project highlights the distinctive effects of these diseases on ncRNA and gene expression compared to normal aging processes.

**Key Objectives**
1. Investigate the Neuroprotective Role of Nicotine: The project hypothesizes that nicotine alters the processing of B2 RNA in AD, contributing to its neuroprotective effects.
2. Differential Processing of B2 in AD Models: We confirm the differential processing of B2 in APP transgenic mice, an established model for AD, and assess the impact of chronic nicotine treatment on B2 transcript levels in Mus musculus.
3. Expression Analysis of B2-Suppressed Genes: Should differential processing of B2 be evident between nicotine-treated and non-treated mice, we explore how chronic nicotine exposure alters the expression of genes suppressed by B2, associated with the stress response.

**Data Sources and Methodology**
**Data Acquisition:** Sequencing data from the APP transgenic Mus musculus hippocampus by the Zovoilis lab at the University of Lethbridge and publicly available data from sources like the GEO database were used. Key datasets include GEO accession numbers GSE117069 and GSE89899.

**Bioinformatics Analysis:** Employed manual literature searches and NCBI keyword searches. Analysis tools included the SRA Toolkit from NCBI for data access, BWA software for mapping short RNAs, HISAT2 for longer RNAs with splice isoforms, and Seqmonk for data visualization and analysis.

**Key Findings**
Increased B2 Processing: A significant increase in B2 processing was observed in 6-month-old APP transgenic mice, interneurons, and the NAc of nicotine-treated mice.
Gene Expression Alterations: Nicotine-treated mice demonstrated a marked increase in both immediate-B2 regulated and non-B2 regulated gene expressions, suggesting potential neuroprotective effects of nicotine against dementia.

Limitations
The study acknowledges potential limitations, including artifacts in sequencing data and constraints in RNA-seq libraries' preparation methods.

Conclusion and Future Work
This project suggests that nicotine might offer neuroprotective effects against dementia by upregulating stress response genes. It opens pathways for future research on the impact of recreational drugs on SINE elements in neurodegenerative diseases and potential new treatment and prevention strategies.
